<p> Active developer since 2021 I have been studying and improving in HTML technologies, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, using them as a guide in my applications always focusing on their main Libraries and Framework for the best applicability in market demand.</p>

<p> I am adventurous, I like challenges, knowledge is the main virtue that we can develop.</p>

<p> I am currently studying information systems at xp education teaching institution participating in its first class of graduation challenge that I decided to face due to the credibility that it has in the market and the confidence transmitted in instituting the project.</p>
